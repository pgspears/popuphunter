A chaotic survival game that sends you back to the dial-up days of the internet. Can you survive the onslaught of pop-ups, toolbars, and early-web shenanigans?

## A long time ago in a browser far, far away....

The year is 1995. It is a time of digital chaos. The Information Superhighway, once a beacon of hope, is now a treacherous road filled with rogue pop-ups and parasitic toolbars.

You, a lone user armed with only a 28.8k modem and a handful of megabytes of RAM, must navigate this perilous landscape. Your mission: survive. Your system's integrity is failing. Prepare to enter... **The ADWARE APOCALYPSE.**

## üî• Features

-   **Endless Survival Gameplay:** Fight to keep your system's `Integrity` above zero as an endless horde of annoyances tries to crash your machine.
-   **Dynamic Difficulty:** From a gentle `Easy` mode to the utterly relentless `INSANE` mode, the chaos scales to your level of masochism.
-   üí£ **Destructive Super-Weapons:** Obliterate on-screen threats with three powerful nuke buttons that operate on a difficulty-based cooldown.
    -   `Nuke Popups`
    -   `Nuke Toolbars`
    -   `ANNIHILATE!`
-   üòÇ **Nostalgic & Humorous Content:**
    -   Relive the horror of authentic 90s toolbars featuring **Bonzi Buddy, Ask Jeeves, Weatherbug**, and more.
    -   Close pop-ups with classic meme-filled messages like "All your base are belong to us" and "The cake is a lie."
-   üí• **Chaotic Gameplay Events:**
    -   A helpful AI assistant "Flippy" who gives terrible advice.
    -   Visual glitches, screen shaking, and performance degradation as your system fails.
    -   Iconic 80s action hero quotes and explosive text accompanying every nuke.
-   üèÜ **Achievement System:** Get rewarded with intrusive "Achievement Unlocked!" pop-ups for reaching milestones.
-   **BSOD Game Over:** When your integrity hits zero, your session ends with the classic Blue Screen of Death and a humorous, taunting restart button.

## üïπÔ∏è How to Play

1.  **Launch the Game:** Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser.
2.  **Watch the Intro:** Enjoy the epic story crawl or click **"SKIP INTRO"** to get straight to the action.
3.  **Choose Your Suffering:** Select a difficulty level.
4.  **Survive:**
    -   Your primary goal is to keep the green **Integrity** bar from depleting.
    -   **Click pop-ups to close them.** Each one you close restores a tiny bit of integrity.
    -   Every pop-up and toolbar that appears drains your integrity and system resources (CPU/RAM).
5.  **Use Your Weapons:**
    -   When the cooldown is ready, use the **Nuke buttons** in the bottom-left to clear the screen. Be warned, the cooldown gets faster on higher difficulties!
6.  **Don't Click Everything!** Clicking on desktop icons or suspicious buttons inside the "browser" will have... unpredictable and negative consequences.
